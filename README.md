**1. Components of a DBMS**

A Database Management System (DBMS) typically consists of the following components:

* **Hardware:** Physical devices like servers, storage devices, and network infrastructure.
* **Software:** The DBMS software itself, including the database engine, query language processor, and utilities.
* **Data:** The actual data stored in the database.
* **Users:** Individuals who interact with the database, either directly or indirectly.

**2. Relational Database**

A relational database organizes data into tables, with rows representing records and columns representing attributes. Each table has a unique primary key to identify records.

Examples of Relational Databases:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle Database
* Microsoft SQL Server

**3. Classifications of SQL**

SQL can be broadly classified into three categories:

* **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Used to define the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting tables and schemas.
* **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Used to manipulate data within a database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.
* **DQL (Data Query Language):** Used to query and retrieve data from a database, such as selecting specific records or generating reports.

**4. Primary Key vs. Foreign Key**

* **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table. It cannot contain null values.
* **Foreign Key:** A column in one table that references the primary key of another table, establishing a link between the two tables.

**5. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

An ERD is a graphical representation of entities (objects) and their relationships in a database. It helps in designing the database schema.

**6. Advantages of Relational Databases**

* Data Integrity
* Data Security
* Data Independence
* Efficient Data Access
* Scalability

**7. Data Types in Tables**

* Numeric
* Character
* Date and Time
* Boolean

**8. Purpose of a DBMS**

A DBMS is a software system designed to manage and organize large amounts of data efficiently. Its primary purposes are:

* Data Storage
* Data Retrieval
* Data Manipulation
* Data Security
* Data Integrity
* Data Sharing
